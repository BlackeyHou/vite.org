At the same time, the bit dimension has the experience of Dapp landing application development, and has developed distributed applications based on the underlying technology of eos and sidechain fibos. Currently, it has a deep understanding and familiarity with Vite related technical documents for the later application of ecological construction. get ready;",

The Bit Dimensional Team firmly believes that in the context of the new era, the new journey, and the new mission, the blockchain revolution must be able to subvert the traditional, complex, over-centered, and inefficient system, serving more transparent and efficient And fair areas. Therefore, the bit-dimensional team is not only committed to node construction, but will use a more precise angle and more abundant power to make a combination of community construction and application development. In the future, the bit dimension team will implement “four more”. : Put forward more Vite project ideas, issue more applications, recruit more investment institutions, and recruit more people of insight.",

            "Beyond the Nano project (one of the most well-known public chains that use DAG) who separates a transfer action into send and receive components and has no smart contract, Vite has built an asynchronous smart contract model by separating the call into request and response actions of a smart contract so they can take place asynchronously and fast.",
            "2. Asynchronous transactions writing and confirmation",
            "In a traditional blockchain setup (e.g., Bitcoin), the speed of writing transactions into a ledger is limited by the speed of packing (the confirmation process of Bitcoin). Vite allows the writing of many transactions into the ledger simultaneously without waiting to be confirmed. Due to the asynchronous setup, transactions are processed at a relatively steady rate, thus reducing the peaks and troughs typically associated with traditional setups which are limited by the speed of packing. Additionally, with this setup there will no longer be situations in which a user sending large numbers of transactions twill prevent other users' transactions from going through. This setup optimizes usage of resources and increases overall system throughput.",
            "3. Asynchronous, message-based calls between contracts",
            "The calls between smart contracts in Ethereum are implemented through internal transactions. These calls either all succeed or all fail, per an atomic ACID semantic. To solve this performance bottleneck, we take advantage of a message-driven architecture and a non-ACID BASE (Basically Available, Soft-state, and Eventual-consistency) model. As such, contracts do not share states and communicate via messages."

These operational improvements are seen within our Solidity++ language. One of those improvements, for example, would be the incorporation of a series of standard libraries. This serves a dual purpose of increasing security protection while simplifying programming complexity. Because Solidity++ inter-contract calls rely on asynchronous architecture, the attacks facilitated by contract synchronous calls are inherently prevented. The classic Ethereum example of a 'reentrancy attack' scenario is not applicable in Vite's case.

The issuance of new tokens with Ethereum requires the user to develop and deploy a smart contract. Token balance is maintained by the state of the contract. If contract development is flawed, security risks surface. For example, if a user forgets to refer to the SaftMath library, an overflow may occur. Vite token is built into the Vite protocol. The token balance is maintained in the state of the user's account. The new token and the Vite native token share the same underlying protocol thus bringing the same measure of security to the new token and native token. When a user decides to issue a new token in Vite, all they need to do is initiate a transaction. The transaction then puts the new token parameters in the transaction data.

Therefore, the probability of rolling back the transaction will not decrease over time. To tackle the problem, Vite invents the snapshot chain technology to take a snapshot of the account chains every second and attach to the snapshot chain as new block.
